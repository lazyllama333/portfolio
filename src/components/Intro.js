                I'm a Computer Science concentrator at Brown University. I'm currently in my third year and plan on pursuing software engineering post-grad.
                I mainly enjoy doing backend work and have very limited experience with the front end. I'm from Brooklyn, NY and enjoy painting, trying new foods, and travelling. You can often find me at a cafe with an iced latte. Scroll down to see some of my work!
